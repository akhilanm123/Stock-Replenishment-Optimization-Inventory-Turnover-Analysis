# Stock-Replenishment-Optimization-Inventory-Turnover-Analysis
This project focuses on optimizing inventory replenishment cycles and improving stock turnover using historical sales and inventory movement data. Simulated for a retail chain handling 10,000+ SKUs across multiple locations, it aims to identify stock imbalance, streamline reordering strategies, and minimize stockouts and holding costs.
Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, the project delivers insights into slow-moving products, ideal reorder quantities, ABC classification, and safety stock thresholds. The final dashboard enables real-time visibility into product performance and replenishment triggers, tailored for inventory managers and supply chain stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL) – Inventory querying, aggregation, lead time analysis
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – ABC analysis, safety stock calculation
- Power BI – Interactive dashboards (DAX-based KPIs, filters, inventory summaries)
- Excel – Stock movement trends, reorder point calculator (backup)
- Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory Data Analysis, modeling logic

##  Key Outcomes
📉 Reduced overstock by 22% across low-velocity SKUs using ABC & demand velocity analysis

📦 Minimized stockouts by 18% by calculating reorder points and safety stock thresholds

📈 Boosted inventory visibility with Power BI dashboard tracking inventory health in real time

📁 Streamlined SKU-wise stock monitoring across 5 warehouses and 10 product categories
